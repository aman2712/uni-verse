          (ISEC) multi-disciplinary social science research institute
          established by Prof. V.K.R.V Rao in 1972, funded by the Indian Council
          of Social Science Research (ICSSR) and the Government of Karnataka.
          The thrust of the institute is to integrate the social science
          research skills in initiating, complementing, participating and
          furthering the social, economic and political changes of the societies
          with an emphasis on equity and justice. Prof. Rao’s vision was to
          build purposeful interactions within social science disciplines as
          well as with other life science streams to create a strong
          interdisciplinary work. ISEC’s concern for the social and economic
          welfare of the poor and disadvantaged groups reflects strongly in the
          large number of studies it has undertaken to understand the various
          dimensions of poverty and human development. Analytical and applied
          research studies particularly in policy-related areas have also been
          areas of priority at ISEC. Central, state and local level governments
          have come to rely on the Institute for evaluation of various policies
          and programmes
