          <br />• Four years of mathematics (including calculus for students
          interested in engineering). <br />• Four years of one language. <br />
          • At least two years of laboratory science (including physics and
          chemistry for students interested in engineering). <br />• At least
          two years of history. In addition, most candidates have had some study

          • REQUIREMENT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO GET ADDMINTED IN ADDITION:

          <br />
          FINANCIAL AID
          <br />
          The full need of all admitted international students is met the same
          as it is for students from the United States. Your family’s ability to
          pay for your university education is not a factor in our admission
          decision. Our financial aid program is entirely based on need.
          Princeton does not offer academic or athletic merit scholarships.

          ENGLISH PROFICIENCY
          <br />
          If English is not your native language and you are attending a school
          where English is not the language of instruction, you must take the
          Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International
          English Language Testing System Academic (IELTS Academic) or the
          Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), in addition to the
          SAT or ACT.

          <br />
          TRANSCRIPT
          <br />
          Your transcript (or your academic record) is evaluated within the
          context of your educational system and school curriculum. Your
          academic record should include any available internal grades from
          classes, achieved marks from external exams (for example: IGCSE,
          British A-Level, International Baccalaureate, national leaving exams
          such as Std X/Std XII in India) or a combination of both. If leaving
          exams are a part of the graduation requirements, please ask your
          school official to submit predicted or achieved results as they become
          available. If your school or national education system does not
          provide internal grades, you are not required to report them. We also
          do not expect you or your school to provide a conversion or
          grade-point average (GPA) if this is not a standard practice provided
          by your school or education system.
          <br />
          <br />
          GRADED WRITTEN PAPER
          <br />
          The graded written paper must be submitted in English and can come
          from Oor A-level coursework, so long as this student-written essay
          meets all of the other requirements listed. The graded written paper
          and teacher comments should not be translated from another language
          into English, they must be written in English. If you are also
          submitting a rubric, that must also be in English.
          <br />
          <br />
          STANDARDIZED TESTING:
          <br />
          Students who opt to apply to Princeton without an ACT or SAT score
          will not be at a disadvantage in our process. Those who still wish to
          sit for standardized testing should do so by the December test date,
          if possible. In our experience, scores from the December test date for
          test takers outside the United States will reach us in time. As with
          previous years, they do not require the submission of SAT Subject
          Tests. If you chose to sit for a Subject Test (prior to January/June
          2021) and wish to submit the score, you may do so. Please know that
          standardized testing is but one element of our comprehensive and
          holistic application review process. They employ no minimum test
          scores for admission; rather, the entirety of a student’s background
          is considered in context. Additionally, do not require applicants to
          submit the optional writing section of the SAT or ACT (the SAT Essay
          or ACT Writing Test). For those who choose to submit testing, they
          allow applicants to use the score choice feature of the SAT and accept
          only the highest composite score of the ACT, but they encourage the
          submission of all test scores.
